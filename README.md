## Description
The objective of this assignment was to create a Tech Blog in which a user can create, update and delete posts after they have logged in. The user can also comment and read the posts other users created. 

To start, I created a schema and model for 3 tables: users, posts, and comments. Next, I created created the routes to Create, Read, Update and Delete the data that they users created. Then, I built handlebars to manage the data that was sent to each page of my website and wrote the script files for telling the application how to store, update or read the data to the database. Finally, I created a stlye.css document to style my website.
